## Transfer Learning in Keras

The code given is used to classify dog into its corresponding breed. You can download the dataset from Kaggle. The link is <a herf="https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification"> here </a>

I have tried three different CNN on the given dataset. 
<ul>
<li> A Custom CNN </li>
<li> A CNN built by transfering the weights of VGG16 </li>
<li> A CNN built by transfering the weights of VGG19 </li>
</ul>

You can see the difference in the accuracy of models between a custom one and the one which utilizes Transfer Learning
